## Good Examples

### bash-audit Skill (Excellent - 10/10)

**File**: `/Users/markayers/.claude/skills/bash-audit/SKILL.md`

**Frontmatter**:

```yaml
---
name: bash-audit
description: Comprehensive security and quality audit for shell scripts (bash, sh, zsh) using defensive programming principles and ShellCheck static analysis. Use when user asks to audit, review, check, lint, validate, or analyze shell scripts for security vulnerabilities, bugs, errors, defensive programming compliance, or best practices. Also triggers for improving script quality, finding script errors or issues, checking portability problems (macOS vs Linux), validating error handling, fixing shellcheck warnings, reviewing legacy automation scripts before release, setting up CI/CD linting infrastructure, configuring pre-commit hooks, understanding ShellCheck error codes, suppressing false positives, or ensuring script portability and quality.
allowed-tools: [Read, Bash, Grep, Edit, Write, Glob]
---
```

**Why It's Excellent**:

## Poor Examples (Before/After)

### Example 1: Too Short

**Before** (✗ Poor - 2/10):

```yaml
---
name: git-helper
description: Helps with git operations
---
```

**Problems**:

- Only 27 chars (way too short)
- "Helps with" is vague
- No specific operations listed
- No use cases
- Generic name
- Would rarely be discovered

**After** (✓ Good - 8/10):

```yaml
---
name: git-workflow
description: Automates git workflows including commits, branches, and PRs. Use when committing changes, creating pull requests, cleaning up history, pushing code, or organizing branches.
---
```

**Improvements**:

- 187 chars (much better)
- Specific: commits, branches, PRs
- Clear use cases
- Action verbs: committing, creating, cleaning, pushing, organizing
- Specific name

### Example 2: Missing "Use When"

**Before** (✗ Poor - 4/10):

```yaml
---
name: bash-audit
description: Comprehensive security and quality audit for shell scripts using ShellCheck static analysis and defensive programming principles.
---
```

**Problems**:

- No use cases listed
- Technical jargon only
- Users don't know when to use it
- Missing action verbs

**After** (✓ Excellent - 10/10):

```yaml
---
name: bash-audit
description: Comprehensive security and quality audit for shell scripts using ShellCheck. Use when auditing scripts, reviewing code quality, finding security issues, fixing shellcheck warnings, checking portability, or validating error handling.
---
```

**Improvements**:

- Added "Use when" with 6 scenarios
- Action verbs: auditing, reviewing, finding, fixing, checking, validating
- Plain language alongside technical terms

### Example 3: Only Technical Terms

**Before** (✗ Poor - 3/10):

```yaml
---
name: static-analyzer
description: Performs static code analysis using AST parsing and linting tools to identify code smells and anti-patterns.
---
```

**Problems**:

- Technical jargon: "AST parsing", "code smells", "anti-patterns"
- No plain language
- Users don't ask for "static analysis"
- No use cases

**After** (✓ Good - 8/10):

```yaml
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for bugs, security issues, and best practices using automated analysis. Use when checking code quality, finding errors, reviewing pull requests, ensuring code safety, or improving code standards.
---
```

**Improvements**:

- Plain language: bugs, security issues, best practices
- Clear use cases
- Action verbs: checking, finding, reviewing, ensuring, improving
- Relatable name

### Example 4: Too Generic

**Before** (✗ Poor - 1/10):

```yaml
---
name: helper
description: General purpose assistant for various tasks
---
```

**Problems**:

- Extremely vague
- "helper" and "assistant" say nothing
- "various tasks" is meaningless
- Would trigger on everything or nothing
- Unusable

**After** (✓ Good - 9/10):

```yaml
---
name: document-organizer
description: Organizes document collections by source, type, and naming conventions. Use when organizing PDFs, managing document folders, creating folder structures, renaming files consistently, detecting duplicates, or auditing file organization.
---
```

**Improvements**:

- Specific capability
- Clear domain (documents)
- Specific use cases
- Actionable triggers

### Example 5: Body Content in Description

**Before** (✗ Poor - 5/10):

```yaml
---
name: git-workflow
description: Git workflow automation
---
## When to Use

- Committing changes
- Creating pull requests
- Cleaning up history
- Managing branches
```

**Problems**:

- Short description (24 chars)
- All use cases in body (doesn't help triggering!)
- Body content loaded AFTER trigger
- Wastes opportunity

**After** (✓ Excellent - 10/10):

```yaml
---
name: git-workflow
description: Git workflow automation for commits, PRs, and history cleanup. Use when committing changes, creating pull requests, cleaning up history, or managing branches.
---
# Git Workflow

Automates complete git workflows...
```

**Improvements**:

- All use cases in description
- Body has workflow details, not triggers
- 166 chars in description
- Would trigger on expected queries

## Progressive Disclosure Examples

### Good Example: bash-audit

**SKILL.md** (315 lines):

```markdown
## Reference Files

- [configurations.md](references/configurations.md) - Config examples
- [error-codes.md](references/error-codes.md) - Error reference
  ...

# Bash Script Audit

Quick workflow, common patterns, integration
```

**references/workflows.md** (250 lines):

```markdown
# Complete Audit Workflows

Step-by-step processes for different scenarios...
```

**Analysis**:

- ✓ Main file <500 lines
- ✓ Details in references
- ✓ Clear linking
- ✓ One level deep
- ✓ Well-organized (6 topic-based files)

**Score**: 9/10 (Excellent)

### Poor Example: Flat Monolith

**SKILL.md** (1200 lines):

```markdown
---
name: comprehensive-guide
description: Complete guide to everything
---

# Everything You Need to Know

[1200 lines of content with no references]
```

**Analysis**:

- ✗ Way over 500 line target
- ✗ No progressive disclosure
- ✗ Hard to navigate
- ✗ Slow to load

**Score**: 2/10 (Poor)

**Fix**: Split into SKILL.md (<500 lines) + 8-10 reference files

## Discovery Score Examples

### Example 1: Excellent Discovery (bash-audit)

**Test Results**:

- Positive Tests: 10/10 triggered
- Negative Tests: 5/5 correctly ignored
- Edge Cases: 2/3 reasonably handled

**Discovery Score**: 10/10

**Description Quality**: 10/10

- 540 chars (comprehensive)
- 15+ use cases
- Both technical and plain language
- Clear triggers

### Example 2: Good Discovery (git-workflow)

**Test Results**:

- Positive Tests: 9/10 triggered
- Negative Tests: 5/5 correctly ignored
- Edge Cases: 3/3 reasonably handled

**Discovery Score**: 9/10

**Gap**: Missing "merge" as trigger

**Recommendation**: Add "merging branches" to description

### Example 3: Poor Discovery (helper)

**Test Results**:

- Positive Tests: 2/10 triggered
- Negative Tests: 3/5 incorrectly triggered
- Edge Cases: All confused

**Discovery Score**: 2/10

**Problems**:

- Too vague
- No specific triggers
- Would match everything/nothing

**Recommendation**: Complete rewrite with specific domain
