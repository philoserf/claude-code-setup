# Examples

Comprehensive examples of good vs poor output-styles, full audit reports, and common mistakes with fixes.

## Good Output-Style Example 1: content-editor

**File**: `~/.claude/output-styles/content-editor.md`

### Content

```yaml
---
name: content-editor
keep-coding-instructions: false
description: Professional content editor for clarity and readability. Use when editing documentation, improving writing quality, simplifying technical content, or enhancing readability. Triggers on "edit", "improve writing", "make clearer", "simplify content".
---

## Persona

You are a professional content editor specializing in technical documentation for software products. You prioritize clarity, conciseness, and readability above stylistic flourishes. You have expertise in plain language principles, information architecture, and audience-appropriate communication.

**Your lens**: "Can a busy reader quickly understand this?"

**Your priority**: Reader comprehension over writer expression.

**Your standard**: Technical accuracy must never be sacrificed for simplicity, but complexity must be justified.

## Behaviors

1. Use active voice unless passive is grammatically necessary or emphasizes the recipient
2. Break sentences longer than 25 words into shorter ones
3. Replace jargon with plain language or define technical terms on first use
4. Add section headers every 3-4 paragraphs for scannability
5. Use bullet points for any list of 3 or more items
6. Limit paragraphs to 3-5 sentences maximum
7. Remove redundant phrases: "in order to" → "to", "due to the fact that" → "because"
8. Front-load key information in the first sentence of each paragraph
9. Use consistent terminology throughout (don't alternate synonyms)
10. Include a brief summary at the start of documents longer than 500 words
```

### Audit Report

**Status**: FAIL

**Critical Issues**:

1. **Vague Persona**
   - **Severity**: CRITICAL
   - **Location**: Persona section (line 6)
   - **Issue**: Generic "helpful and knowledgeable" - no specific role
   - **Impact**: Unclear transformation, poor discoverability
   - **Fix**: Define specific role with expertise:

   ```markdown
   ## Persona

   You are a professional content editor specializing in technical documentation.
   You have expertise in plain language principles, information architecture,
   and audience-appropriate communication. You prioritize clarity and readability
   while maintaining technical accuracy.
   ```

2. **Abstract Behaviors**
   - **Severity**: CRITICAL
   - **Location**: Behaviors section (lines 10-12)
   - **Issue**: All behaviors are abstract values, not actionable instructions
   - **Impact**: No concrete transformation guidance
   - **Fix**: Replace with specific actions:

   ```markdown
   ## Behaviors

   1. Use active voice unless passive is grammatically necessary
   2. Break sentences longer than 25 words into shorter ones
   3. Replace jargon with plain language or define technical terms
   4. Add section headers every 3-4 paragraphs for scannability
   5. Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
   6. Limit paragraphs to 3-5 sentences maximum
   7. Remove redundant phrases ("in order to" → "to")
   8. Front-load key information in first sentences
   ```

3. **Missing keep-coding-instructions Decision**
   - **Severity**: IMPORTANT
   - **Location**: Frontmatter (line 3)
   - **Issue**: No explicit decision (defaults to false)
   - **Recommendation**: Add explicit decision based on role type

4. **Missing Description**
   - **Severity**: CRITICAL
   - **Location**: Frontmatter
   - **Issue**: No description field for discoverability
   - **Impact**: Poor discovery, won't auto-trigger
   - **Fix**: Add comprehensive description

**Scores**:

- Persona Clarity: 1/10 (completely generic)
- Behavior Quality: 1/10 (all abstract, not actionable)
- keep-coding-instructions: ⚠ Not specified (defaults to false)
- Scope Alignment: ✓ User scope appropriate for personal style

**Overall**: 2/10 (Very Poor - Requires complete rewrite)

**Priority Fixes**:

1. Define specific role and expertise in persona
2. Replace all abstract behaviors with concrete, actionable instructions
3. Add comprehensive description with trigger phrases
4. Explicitly set keep-coding-instructions based on role type

## Full Audit Report Example

### Output-Style: technical-writer

**File**: `~/.claude/output-styles/technical-writer.md`

**Scope**: User (personal)

**Audited**: 2025-01-15 16:45

**Summary**: Output-style for technical writing has appropriate persona and behaviors, but keep-coding-instructions decision needs clarification for role type.

**Compliance Status**: NEEDS WORK

- **Persona**: ✓ specific - clear role with expertise
- **Behaviors**: ✓ 8 behaviors - mostly concrete and actionable
- **keep-coding-instructions**: ⚠ false - verify if appropriate (technical writers may include code examples)
- **Scope**: ✓ aligned - personal preference in user scope
- **Description**: ✓ comprehensive - includes use cases and triggers

### Critical Issues

None

### Important Issues

**1. Clarify keep-coding-instructions Decision**

- **Severity**: IMPORTANT
- **Location**: Frontmatter (line 3)
- **Issue**: keep-coding-instructions: false may be inappropriate if role includes code examples
- **Current Persona**: "You are a technical writer focused on API documentation and developer guides"
- **Assessment**: API documentation typically includes code examples
- **Recommendation**: Consider changing to `keep-coding-instructions: true` if significant code example writing is expected

**Fix**:

```yaml
---
name: technical-writer
keep-coding-instructions: true # API docs include extensive code examples
---
```

Or document why false is appropriate:

```markdown
## Persona

You are a technical writer focused on high-level architecture documentation and
user guides. You describe APIs conceptually but don't write code examples
(developers provide those).
```

### Nice-to-Have Improvements

**1. Add Conditional Logic to Behaviors**

- **Location**: Behaviors section
- **Suggestion**: Add when/unless conditions for flexibility

**Current**:

```markdown
1. Use active voice
```

**Enhanced**:

```markdown
1. Use active voice unless passive emphasizes the recipient or the state change
```

**2. Expand Expertise in Persona**

- **Location**: Persona section
- **Suggestion**: List specific documentation tools or standards

**Enhancement**:

```markdown
**Your expertise**:

- OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Developer portal design
- Code example best practices
- Markdown and static site generators (Docusaurus, MkDocs)
```

### Recommendations

**Critical**: None

**Important**:

1. Clarify keep-coding-instructions decision based on code example expectations

**Nice-to-Have**:

1. Add conditional logic to behaviors for flexibility
2. Expand expertise details in persona

### Next Steps

1. Review typical documentation output - does it include code examples?
2. If yes (>25% code): Change to `keep-coding-instructions: true`
3. If no (<25% code): Keep false and document in persona why code examples are minimal
4. Re-run audit to verify improvements

**Expected Status After Fixes**: PASS
