# Prints the body of one version's CHANGELOG section — everything between
# "## <version>" and the next "## " heading, with surrounding blank lines
# trimmed. Used by obsidian-release-ship phase 8 to set GitHub release notes.
#
# Usage: extract-changelog.sh <VERSION> [CHANGELOG_PATH]
#   CHANGELOG_PATH defaults to CHANGELOG.md in the repo root.
#
# Exit 0: section found and printed.
# Exit 1: no such section, or the file is missing.
#
# A naive `sed -n '/^## X/,/^## /p'` is wrong twice over: it prints the heading
# line of the *next* release, and for the newest entry (no following heading) it
# runs to end of file only by accident of the range never closing. It also
# treats the version's dots as regex wildcards, so "1.2.3" matches "1a2b3".
