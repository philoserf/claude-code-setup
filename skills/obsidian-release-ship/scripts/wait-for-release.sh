# Waits for the release-workflow run belonging to a specific tag to finish, then
# prints its conclusion. Used by the obsidian-release-ship skill after pushing a
# tag, since macOS BSD userland has no timeout(1) to bound the poll.
#
# Usage: wait-for-release.sh <TAG> [MAX_SECONDS] [INTERVAL_SECONDS]
#   TAG              the tag just pushed (e.g. 2.4.0) — required
#   MAX_SECONDS      total time to wait before giving up (default 600)
#   INTERVAL_SECONDS delay between polls (default 15)
#
# Prints the run's conclusion (e.g. "success", "failure") to stdout on completion.
# Exit 0: run completed (check the printed conclusion — "success" means shipped).
# Exit 1: timed out, or no run for this tag appeared; stop and investigate.
#
# Why the tag is required rather than "the latest release.yml run":
#
#   There is a gap of several seconds between `git push origin <tag>` and the
#   run appearing in the API. Land in that gap while polling for the *latest*
#   run and you get the PREVIOUS release's run — already completed/success — so
#   the script reports success for a release that never started. Tag-push runs
#   report the tag as their headBranch, so filtering on it is exact.
