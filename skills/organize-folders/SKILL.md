# Folder Organization Guidance

This skill provides **guidance and recommendations** for organizing folder structures and file system layouts. It helps you design effective file organization but doesn't automatically reorganize files.

## User Preferences

The user prefers simple, practical systems with a typical pattern:

- drafts
- published

The user prefers top-level folders for nesting but repository design is flexible. Recommend whatever system best fits the task, keeping things simple.

## Examples

### Writing Project: Blog Post Rewrite

For a blog post rewrite targeting a more technical audience:

- Create a new folder called `/rewrite`
- Within that folder, create subfolders like `/rewrite/v1`, `/rewrite/v2` or `/rewrite/drafts`

**When to use versioned folders** (v1, v2):

- Rewrite involves multiple assets (text + images) that need to stay together
- Each version is a complete package

**When to use drafts folder**:

- Text-only rewrites without supporting files
- Simpler iteration process

### Document Collection

For organizing a collection of PDF documents:

- Organize by source/publisher first, then by type
- Use flat structures only for small collections (<30 files)
- Create subdirectories when folders exceed ~50 files
- Document file counts in README.md at collection root

### Code Project

For a multi-component software project:

- `/src` - source code organized by feature or layer
- `/tests` - test files mirroring src structure
- `/docs` - documentation
- `/scripts` - automation and build scripts

### Photo/Media Library

For organizing photos, videos, or media files:

- By date: `/2024/01-January`, `/2024/02-February` (chronological)
- By event: `/Vacation-Hawaii-2024`, `/Birthday-Party-2024` (event-based)
- Hybrid: `/2024/Hawaii-Vacation`, `/2024/Birthday` (year + event)

Choose based on retrieval patterns - date for large collections, events for memorable occasions.

### Research Project

For academic or research work with papers and notes:

- `/papers` - PDFs organized by topic or author
- `/notes` - Reading notes and annotations
- `/writing` - Drafts of your own work
- `/data` - Datasets and analysis results
- `/references` - Bibliography and citation management

## General Principles

- **Start simple**: Use one file/folder until you need more
- **Split when needed**: Create subdirectories when folders get too large (~50+ items)
- **Name consistently**: Establish conventions early
- **Document structure**: Add README.md explaining organization when non-obvious
- **Follow the simplest solution that will get the job done**

## Common Organization Problems

### Too Many Files in One Folder

When a folder exceeds ~50 items, it becomes hard to navigate:

- **Solution**: Create subdirectories by logical grouping (type, date, category)
- **Example**: Split `/documents` into `/documents/contracts`, `/documents/reports`, `/documents/invoices`

### Deeply Nested Structures

More than 3-4 levels of nesting makes files hard to find:

- **Solution**: Flatten by combining middle levels or using more descriptive names
- **Example**: `/projects/client/2024/Q1/reports` → `/projects/client-2024-Q1-reports`

### Inconsistent Naming

Mixed conventions (spaces vs dashes, capitalization) cause confusion:

- **Solution**: Pick one convention and apply consistently
- **Recommended**: kebab-case for code projects, Title Case for documents
