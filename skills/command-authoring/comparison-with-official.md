## Executive Summary

### What They Have That We Don't

1. **Comprehensive frontmatter field documentation** - Detailed specs for all YAML fields
2. **Dynamic arguments documentation** - `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$2`, positional args
3. **File references (@syntax)** - How to include file contents in commands
4. **Bash execution (!` syntax)** - Inline bash for dynamic context
5. **Command organization patterns** - Flat vs namespaced structures
6. **Validation patterns** - Argument validation, file existence checks, error handling
7. **Common command patterns** - Review, Testing, Documentation, Workflow patterns
8. **Troubleshooting section** - Common problems and solutions
9. **Critical framing** - "Commands are instructions FOR Claude, not messages to users"

### What We Have That They Don't

1. **Focus on delegation over implementation** - Strong emphasis on simple delegation
2. **Design pattern taxonomy** - Four clear patterns with selection criteria
3. **Step-by-step creation process** - Structured 7-step workflow
4. **Delegation clarity** - Emphasis on documenting delegation targets
5. **Commands vs Skills decision guide** - When to use each
6. **Simplicity emphasis** - "Commands should be simple" philosophy
7. **Concrete examples with analysis** - Real examples with "Why it's good" commentary

### Key Philosophical Differences

**Official**: Comprehensive technical reference covering all features
**Ours**: Opinionated guide emphasizing simplicity and delegation

---

## Detailed Analysis

## 1. Skill Description & Triggering

### Official

```yaml
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a slash command",
"add a command", "write a custom command", "define command arguments",
"use command frontmatter", "organize commands", "create command with file references",
"interactive command", "use AskUserQuestion in command", or needs guidance on
slash command structure, YAML frontmatter fields, dynamic arguments, bash execution
in commands, user interaction patterns, or command development best practices for Claude Code.
```

**Analysis**:

- Very comprehensive list of triggers
- Includes technical features (frontmatter, arguments, file references)
- Covers interaction patterns
- Plugin-oriented (mentions AskUserQuestion in commands)

### Ours

```yaml
description: Guide for authoring, creating, writing, building, reviewing, or
improving slash commands that delegate to agents or skills. Use when designing
/commands for user shortcuts, fixing existing commands, or learning command best
practices. Helps design simple command files, choose delegation targets, handle
arguments, and decide when to use commands vs skills. Also triggers when asking
how to create commands, whether to use a command vs skill, or understanding command
patterns. Expert in command patterns, best practices, and keeping commands focused.
```

**Analysis**:

- Emphasizes delegation to agents/skills
- Focuses on "shortcuts" concept
- Includes decision guidance (commands vs skills)
- Shorter but still comprehensive

**Recommendation**: Consider adding these triggers to ours:

- "define command arguments"
- "use command frontmatter"
- "handle command arguments"

---

## 2. Core Philosophy

### Official: "Commands are Instructions FOR Claude"

Their critical insight (lines 30-52):

> Commands are written for agent consumption, not human consumption.
> When a user invokes `/command-name`, the command content becomes Claude's instructions.
> Write commands as directives TO Claude about what to do, not as messages TO the user.

**Example**:
✅ Correct: "Review this code for security vulnerabilities including..."
❌ Incorrect: "This command will review your code for security issues."

**Impact**: This is a **fundamental framing** that prevents user-facing documentation in command prompts.

### Ours: "Commands Should Be Simple"

Our golden rule (lines 42-76):

> Commands delegate, they don't implement.

**Example**:
✅ Good: Simple delegation to agent/skill
❌ Bad: 50 lines of implementation details

**Impact**: This prevents complexity bloat and keeps commands maintainable.

**Synthesis**: Both philosophies are valuable:

- Theirs: Prevents wrong audience (writing to users vs Claude)
- Ours: Prevents wrong scope (implementing vs delegating)

**Recommendation**: Add their "instructions FOR Claude" framing to our skill.

---

## 3. Frontmatter Documentation

### Official Coverage

Comprehensive field documentation (lines 112-193):

1. **description** - Brief description, shown in `/help`, under 60 chars
2. **allowed-tools** - Tool restrictions (Read, Write, Bash(git:\*), etc.)
3. **model** - Specify model (sonnet, opus, haiku)
4. **argument-hint** - Document expected arguments for autocomplete
5. **disable-model-invocation** - Prevent programmatic calling

Each field includes:

- Purpose
- Type
- Default value
- Example YAML
- Best practices
- Use cases

### Our Coverage

Minimal frontmatter mention:

- We mention description is "required"
- Reference to argument-hint in examples
- No detailed field documentation

**Gap Analysis**:
We're missing comprehensive coverage of:

- `allowed-tools` - Critical for security/permissions
- `model` - Important for performance/cost
- `disable-model-invocation` - Controls programmatic access

**Recommendation**: Add frontmatter reference file documenting all official fields.

---

## 4. Dynamic Arguments

### Official Coverage (lines 195-264)

**Three argument patterns**:

1. **$ARGUMENTS** - All arguments as single string

   ```markdown
   Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following coding standards
   # /fix-issue 123 → "Fix issue #123 following coding standards"
   ```

2. **Positional ($1, $2, $3)** - Individual argument access

   ```markdown
   Review pull request #$1 with priority level $2
   # /review-pr 123 high → "Review pull request #123 with priority level high"
   ```

3. **Combined** - Mix positional and remaining

   ```markdown
   Deploy $1 to $2 environment with options: $3
   # /deploy api staging --force → "Deploy api to staging environment with options: --force"
   ```

### Our Coverage

Minimal argument documentation:

- Mention of `$ARGUMENTS` and `$1, $2` in creation process
- No detailed examples or patterns
- No explanation of differences

**Gap**: We don't teach users **how** to use arguments effectively.

**Recommendation**: Add arguments reference file with:

- When to use $ARGUMENTS vs positional
- How arguments are substituted
- Common patterns
- Edge cases (missing args, spaces, etc.)

---

## 5. File References (@syntax)

### Official Coverage (lines 265-315)

**Three file reference patterns**:

1. **Dynamic file with argument**

   ```markdown
   Review @$1 for code quality
   # /review-file src/api/users.ts → reads that file
   ```

2. **Multiple file references**

   ```markdown
   Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
   ```

3. **Static file references**

   ```markdown
   Review @package.json and @tsconfig.json for consistency
   ```

### Our Coverage

**None** - We don't document file references at all.

**Gap**: Users don't know they can include file contents in commands.

**Recommendation**: Add file references to our documentation:

- When to use @ syntax vs asking Claude to read files
- How it's processed (file read before command execution)
- Best practices (relative paths, file existence)

---

## 6. Bash Execution (!` syntax)

### Official Coverage (lines 316-327)

Mentions bash execution with deferred details:

> Commands can execute bash commands inline to dynamically gather context
> For complete syntax, examples, and best practices, see `references/plugin-features-reference.md`

**Use cases mentioned**:

- Include dynamic context (git status, environment vars)
- Gather project/repository state
- Build context-aware workflows

### Our Coverage

**None** - We don't mention bash execution.

**Gap**: Missing a powerful feature for dynamic commands.

**Decision Point**: Do we want to include this?

- **Pros**: Enables dynamic, context-aware commands
- **Cons**: Adds complexity, potential security issues, goes against our "simplicity" philosophy

**Recommendation**: Document with caution, emphasize:

- Use sparingly
- Delegate to agents/skills for complex logic
- Security implications of bash execution
- Should enhance delegation, not replace it

---

## 7. Command Organization

### Official Coverage (lines 328-369)

**Two organization patterns**:

1. **Flat structure** (5-15 commands)

   ```text
   .claude/commands/
   ├── build.md
   ├── test.md
   └── deploy.md
   ```

2. **Namespaced structure** (15+ commands)

   ```text
   .claude/commands/
   ├── ci/
   │   ├── build.md    # /build (project:ci)
   │   └── test.md     # /test (project:ci)
   └── git/
       └── commit.md   # /commit (project:git)
   ```

**Benefits of namespacing**:

- Logical grouping
- Namespace shown in `/help`
- Easier to find related commands

### Our Coverage

**None** - We don't cover organization patterns.

**Gap**: Users with many commands don't know about namespacing.

**Recommendation**: Add organization guidance:

- When to use flat vs namespaced
- How namespacing works
- Impact on `/help` display
- Migration path (flat → namespaced)

---

## 8. Validation Patterns

### Official Coverage (lines 751-829)

**Four validation types**:

1. **Argument validation**

   ```markdown
   Validate environment: !`echo "$1" | grep -E "^(dev|staging|prod)$" || echo "INVALID"`

   If $1 is valid environment:
     Deploy to $1
   Otherwise:
     Explain valid environments
   ```

2. **File existence checks**

   ```markdown
   Check file exists: !`test -f $1 && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"`
   ```

3. **Resource validation**

   ```markdown
   Validate setup:
   - Script: !`test -x script.sh && echo "✓" || echo "✗"`
   - Config: !`test -f config.json && echo "✓" || echo "✗"`
   ```

4. **Error handling**

   ```markdown
   Execute build: !`bash build.sh 2>&1 || echo "BUILD_FAILED"`

   If build succeeded:
     Report success
   If build failed:
     Analyze errors and suggest fixes
   ```

### Our Coverage

**None** - We don't cover validation.

**Gap**: Commands fail ungracefully with bad input.

**Decision Point**: Do validation patterns fit our delegation philosophy?

- **Consider**: If commands delegate to agents/skills, the agent/skill should validate
- **But**: Basic argument checking can prevent bad delegations

**Recommendation**: Add minimal validation guidance:

- Validate arguments before delegation
- Let agents/skills handle complex validation
- Provide helpful error messages
- Use AskUserQuestion for clarification when needed

---

## 9. Common Command Patterns

### Official Coverage (lines 434-501)

**Four reusable patterns**:

1. **Review Pattern**

   ```markdown
   Files changed: !`git diff --name-only`
   Review each file for: quality, bugs, tests, docs
   ```

2. **Testing Pattern**

   ```markdown
   Run tests: !`npm test $1`
   Analyze results and suggest fixes
   ```

3. **Documentation Pattern**

   ```markdown
   Generate docs for @$1 including:
   - Function descriptions
   - Parameters
   - Usage examples
   ```

4. **Workflow Pattern**

   ```markdown
   PR #$1 Workflow:
   1. Fetch PR: !`gh pr view $1`
   2. Review changes
   3. Run checks
   ```

### Our Coverage

**Different focus**: We provide patterns based on delegation complexity:

- Pattern 1: Simple Agent Delegator
- Pattern 2: Skill Delegator
- Pattern 3: Documented Agent Delegator
- Pattern 4: Multi-Agent Orchestrator

**Comparison**:

- **Theirs**: Task-based patterns (what the command does)
- **Ours**: Structure-based patterns (how the command delegates)

**Synthesis**: Both are valuable:

- Task patterns help users solve specific problems
- Structure patterns help users build well-organized commands

**Recommendation**: Keep our structure patterns, optionally add task pattern examples.

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Official Coverage (lines 502-526)

**Four common problems**:

1. **Command not appearing**
   - Check correct directory
   - Verify `.md` extension
   - Ensure valid Markdown
   - Restart Claude Code

2. **Arguments not working**
   - Verify syntax ($1, $2)
   - Check argument-hint
   - No extra spaces

3. **Bash execution failing**
   - Check allowed-tools
   - Verify syntax
   - Test in terminal
   - Check permissions

4. **File references not working**
   - Verify @ syntax
   - Check file path
   - Ensure Read tool allowed

### Our Coverage

**None** - We don't have troubleshooting.

**Gap**: Users hit problems with no guidance.

**Recommendation**: Add troubleshooting section covering:

- Command not appearing in `/help`
- Arguments not substituting
- Delegation not working
- Common syntax errors

---

## 11. Best Practices

### Official (lines 370-433)

**Five categories**:

1. **Command Design**
   - Single responsibility
   - Clear descriptions
   - Explicit dependencies (allowed-tools)
   - Document arguments (argument-hint)
   - Consistent naming (verb-noun)

2. **Argument Handling**
   - Validate arguments
   - Provide defaults
   - Document format
   - Handle edge cases

3. **File References**
   - Explicit paths
   - Check existence
   - Relative paths
   - Glob support

4. **Bash Commands**
   - Limit scope (Bash(git:_) not Bash(_))
   - Safe commands (no destructive ops)
   - Handle errors
   - Keep fast

5. **Documentation**
   - Add comments
   - Provide examples
   - List requirements
   - Version commands

### Ours (lines 167-188)

**Eight tips**:

1. Keep commands under 50 lines
2. Delegate, don't implement
3. Test with `/help`
4. Use descriptive names
5. Document delegation target
6. Make purpose clear
7. Optional arguments better
8. Start simple

**Comparison**:

- **Theirs**: Comprehensive, technical, covers all features
- **Ours**: Focused on simplicity and delegation

**Synthesis**: Our tips are more philosophical, theirs more practical.

**Recommendation**: Combine both:

- Keep our delegation philosophy
- Add their practical technical advice
