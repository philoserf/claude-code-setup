# Fixture tests for the release-gate version/tag state machine and the ship
# skill's changelog extractor. Builds throwaway git repos in a temp dir —
# nothing here touches a real project.
#
# Assertions are row-level, not just on the aggregate exit code. A fixture repo
# cannot satisfy every check: `gh` has no remote to query (checks 4, 5, 12 WARN)
# and `bun audit` has no lockfile to audit (check 9 FAILs). Asserting only on the
# exit code would let these tests pass for the wrong reason — a scenario could
# "correctly" report BLOCKED because of the audit rather than because of the tag
# logic under test.
#
# Usage: tests/exit-codes.sh
