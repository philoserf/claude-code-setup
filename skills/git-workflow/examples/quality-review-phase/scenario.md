# Scenario: Quality Review Phase

## Situation

About to push commits to remote. Want to verify quality first.

## Phase 4.5 Checks

Automated quality review checks:

1. Commit message quality
2. No generic messages ("WIP", "fix", etc.)
3. Proper formatting
4. Co-authorship attribution

## When to Override

Sometimes generic messages are acceptable:

- Quick fixes on personal branches
- Internal experimentation
- Draft PRs

But generally aim for descriptive messages.
