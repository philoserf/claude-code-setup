name: git-workflow
description: Automates complete git workflows including branch management, atomic commits with formatted messages, history cleanup, and PR creation. Use when the user wants to commit changes, push to remote, create a PR, clean up commits, mentions atomic commits, git workflow, or needs help organizing git changes. Also use when user is on main/master with uncommitted changes (suggest branching), has messy commit history to clean up before pushing, wants to squash or reorder commits, or needs help creating pull requests.

## Workflow Overview

The skill follows a 6-phase workflow:

0. **Branch Management** - Ensure work is on appropriate branch
1. **Repository Analysis** - Understand current state and changes
2. **Organize into Atomic Commits** - Group related changes logically
3. **Create Commits** - Generate well-formatted commit messages
4. **Commit History Cleanup** - Optionally reorganize commits before push
5. **Push with Confirmation** - Push changes to remote after approval
6. **Pull Request Creation** - Optionally create PR with generated description

## Phase 0: Branch Management

**Goal**: Ensure work is happening on an appropriate branch.

If the user is on a protected branch (main/master/develop), suggest creating a feature branch with an appropriate name based on the type of work (feature/, fix/, refactor/, docs/, test/).

Skip this phase if the user is already on a feature branch or explicitly wants to commit to the current branch.

**For detailed steps, see [references/workflow-phases.md#phase-0-branch-management](references/workflow-phases.md#phase-0-branch-management).**

## Phase 1: Repository Analysis

**Goal**: Thoroughly understand the current repository state and changes.

Run git commands to see changed files, diffs, and recent history. Analyze to identify types of changes, affected files, logical groupings, and untracked files.

Perform safety checks for merge conflicts and rebase-in-progress before proceeding.

**For detailed steps, see [references/workflow-phases.md#phase-1-repository-analysis](references/workflow-phases.md#phase-1-repository-analysis).**

## Phase 2: Organize into Atomic Commits

**Goal**: Group changes into logical, atomic commits that each represent a single coherent change.

Apply atomic commit principles: one logical change per commit, self-contained and compilable, related changes together.

Group changes by priority: bug fixes → tests → refactoring → features → documentation → configuration.

Create a commit plan and present to user for approval. Use TodoWrite to track commits if there are 3+.

**For detailed steps and grouping strategy, see [references/workflow-phases.md#phase-2-organize-into-atomic-commits](references/workflow-phases.md#phase-2-organize-into-atomic-commits).**

## Phase 3: Create Commits

**Goal**: Create each commit with a properly formatted commit message.

For each commit: stage files, generate well-formatted commit message (≤72 chars, imperative mood, explains WHY), execute commit using heredoc, and verify success.

**Key commit message rules**:

- Imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added"
- Be specific: "Fix null pointer in login" not "Fix bug"
- Explain WHY, not WHAT
- Summary ≤72 characters, body wrapped at 72

**For detailed formatting rules, examples, and templates, see [references/commit-format.md](references/commit-format.md).**

**For detailed steps, see [references/workflow-phases.md#phase-3-create-commits](references/workflow-phases.md#phase-3-create-commits).**

## Phase 4: Commit History Cleanup (Optional)

**Goal**: Optionally reorganize recent commits for a cleaner history before pushing.

Offer cleanup when multiple commits could be squashed, messages need improvement, or better ordering would help. Skip if commits are already pushed (unless explicit force push approval), on shared branch, or only one commit.

**IMPORTANT**: NEVER use `git rebase -i` (requires interactive input). Instead, explain manual commands to user or use non-interactive alternatives like `git reset --soft`.

**For detailed rebase safety guidelines, commands, and examples, see [references/rebase-guide.md](references/rebase-guide.md).**

**For detailed steps, see [references/workflow-phases.md#phase-4-commit-history-cleanup-optional](references/workflow-phases.md#phase-4-commit-history-cleanup-optional).**

## Phase 5: Push with Confirmation

**Goal**: Push commits to remote after user approval.

Show summary of commits to be pushed (number, branch, commit messages), ask for confirmation, then push. Use `-u` flag for new branches.

Perform safety checks: verify remote exists, warn if pushing to main/master without PR, handle failures gracefully.

**For detailed steps, see [references/workflow-phases.md#phase-5-push-with-confirmation](references/workflow-phases.md#phase-5-push-with-confirmation).**

## Phase 6: Pull Request Creation (Optional)

**Goal**: Optionally create a pull request after successful push.

After successful push, ask if user wants a PR. Verify `gh` CLI is available, detect base branch, generate title and description from commits, show for review, then create PR and show URL.

If `gh` not available, provide GitHub web URL for manual PR creation.

**For detailed steps, see [references/workflow-phases.md#phase-6-pull-request-creation-optional](references/workflow-phases.md#phase-6-pull-request-creation-optional).**

## Safety Checks

Always perform these checks during the workflow:

1. **Before any operation**:
   - Check for merge conflicts in files
   - Check for rebase/merge in progress
   - Alert user and stop if found

2. **Before committing**:
   - Verify files are actually changed
   - Check commit message meets format requirements

3. **Before rebasing**:
   - Verify commits haven't been pushed (or get explicit force-push approval)
   - Check not on protected branch
   - Ensure working directory is clean

4. **Before pushing**:
   - Verify remote exists
   - Check if pushing to protected branch directly
   - Confirm with user

5. **Before creating PR**:
   - Verify push succeeded
   - Check branch exists on remote
   - Verify gh CLI or provide alternative

## Common Edge Cases

**No changes to commit**:

- Inform user repository is clean
- Exit gracefully

**Untracked files found**:

- List untracked files
- Ask if any should be included
- Identify files that should be .gitignored (.env, debug logs, etc.)
- Add to .gitignore if appropriate

**Large changesets** (10+ files or 500+ lines):

- May need user guidance for grouping
- Suggest reviewing changes carefully
- Consider breaking into multiple PRs

**Detached HEAD state**:

- Alert user
- Explain situation
- Offer to create branch from current commit

**Merge conflicts**:

- Do not proceed with commits
- Alert user to resolve conflicts first
- Show conflicted files and suggest resolution steps

**No remote configured**:

- Detect with `git remote -v`
- Ask if user wants to add remote
- Help set up origin if needed

**Protected branch** (committing to main/master):

- Warn user this is not recommended
- Strongly suggest creating feature branch
- Only proceed if user explicitly confirms

**Rebase in progress**:

- Detect state
- Alert user
- Ask if they want to continue or abort:
  - Continue: User must resolve manually
  - Abort: Run `git rebase --abort`

## Tool Usage Examples

**Check current state**:

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline -n 10
```

**Analyze changes**:

```bash
git diff
git diff --staged
git diff --stat
```

**Create commits**:

```bash
git add file1.js file2.js
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Add user authentication feature

Implement JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints.

- Add login/logout endpoints
- Implement JWT token generation and validation
- Add authentication middleware
EOF
)"
```

**Push changes**:

```bash
# New branch
git push -u origin feature/user-auth

# Existing branch
git push
```

**Create PR**:

```bash
gh pr create --title "Add user authentication" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

EOF
)"
```

## User Interaction Patterns

Use **AskUserQuestion** for:

- Branch creation confirmation
- Commit plan approval
- Modifications to commit grouping
- Push confirmation
- PR creation confirmation
- Force push warnings
- Protected branch warnings

Use **TodoWrite** for:

- Tracking multiple commits to create (3+ commits)
- Long workflow with many steps
- Keeping user informed of progress

Use **Bash** for:

- All git commands
- All gh commands
- Repository state inspection

## Summary

This skill automates the entire Git workflow from analyzing changes to creating a PR. It emphasizes:

- **Quality** over speed - well-formatted commits are important
- **Safety** first - always check state and confirm destructive operations
- **User control** - ask for approval at key decision points
- **Education** - explain what's happening and why

The goal is to help users maintain clean, professional Git history with minimal effort while teaching best practices along the way.
