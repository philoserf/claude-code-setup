# Claude Code Setup

A comprehensive, production-ready configuration for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) demonstrating best practices for customization and automation.

## What's Included

- **13 Commands**: Common workflows (audit, create agents/skills, git automation)
- **2 Agents**: Specialized assistants (evaluator, test runner)
- **18 Skills**: Advanced capabilities (auditing, authoring, git, PDF processing)
- **7 Hooks**: Automation (validation, formatting, logging, notifications)
- **Complete Documentation**: Decision guides, naming conventions, and references

## Installation

Don't install this. Just steal what you like.

## Quick Start

After installation, review and customize:

1. **Edit `settings.json`** - Adjust tool permissions for your needs
2. **Modify `CLAUDE.md`** - Add your personal coding principles and preferences
3. **Use `/create-*` commands** - Create your own agents, skills, commands, output-styles
4. **Explore references** - See `references/decision-matrix.md` to choose the right component type

### Personal Files

`CLAUDE.md` contains my personal coding principles and preferences as examples. Feel free to adapt these to your own style or replace with your own guidelines.

## Key Concepts

### Permission Model

Claude Code uses a permission system defined in `settings.json`:

- **Allowed Operations**: Tools and file patterns that don't require user approval
- **Denied Operations**: Blocked operations (e.g., reading `.env` files, `sudo` commands)
- **Ask First**: Everything else requires explicit user approval

### Project Tracking

Claude Code tracks projects in the `projects/` directory using encoded directory names (e.g., `-Users-markayers-source-mine-go`). Each project stores:

- Session costs and token usage
- File counts and modification stats
- Cache performance metrics

### Session Management

- Sessions are identified by UUIDs
- Session data persists for 30 days (configurable via `cleanupPeriodDays`)
- Todos, plans, and file history are session-scoped
- Shell snapshots capture environment state per session

## Customization

Use the `/create-*` commands for guided creation of customizations:

### Creating Agents

```bash
/create-agent [agent-name]
```

Invokes the **agent-authoring** skill to guide you through:

- Defining purpose and scope
- Selecting model (Sonnet/Haiku/Opus)
- Configuring tool restrictions
- Writing specific focus areas
- Documenting approach/methodology

**Examples**: Read-only analyzers, code generators, workflow orchestrators

### Creating Skills

```bash
/create-skill [skill-name]
```

Invokes the **skill-authoring** skill to guide you through:

- Defining capability and triggers
- Writing comprehensive descriptions
- Organizing with progressive disclosure
- Structuring references directory
- Configuring allowed-tools

**Examples**: Domain knowledge, workflows, best practices

### Creating Commands

```bash
/create-command [command-name]
```

Invokes the **command-authoring** skill to guide you through:

- Designing delegation patterns
- Handling arguments
- Keeping commands simple (6-80 lines)
- Deciding command vs skill

**Examples**: User shortcuts, quick templates, explicit workflows

### Creating Output-Styles

```bash
/create-output-style [style-name]
```

Invokes the **output-style-authoring** skill to guide you through:

- Defining persona and role
- Specifying concrete behaviors
- Deciding on keep-coding-instructions
- Setting appropriate scope (user/project)

**Examples**: Technical writer, QA tester, learning mode

### Creating Hooks

Hooks are created manually as shell scripts. Use the **hook-audit** skill for validation:

```bash
/validate-hook [hook-name]
```

**Key requirements**:

- Exit code 0 = allow operation
- Exit code 2 = block operation
- Fast execution (<100ms recommended)
- Configure in `settings.json`

**Examples**: Auto-formatting, validation, logging, policy enforcement

## Active Hooks

This configuration includes 7 active hooks that automate workflows and enforce quality standards:

### PreToolUse Hooks

Run before tool execution and can block operations if needed.

#### log-git-commands.sh

**Trigger**: Before any `Bash` command
**Purpose**: Logs all git, gh, and dot (dotfiles) commands to stderr for tracking
**Behavior**: Informational only - never blocks execution
**Timeout**: 5 seconds

Example output: `[Hook] Git command: git status`

#### validate-bash-commands.py

**Trigger**: Before any `Bash` command
**Purpose**: Suggests better alternatives when using bash for operations that have dedicated tools
**Behavior**: Informational only - never blocks execution
**Timeout**: 5 seconds

Examples:

- Suggests `Read` tool instead of `cat`, `head`, `tail`
- Suggests `Grep` tool instead of `grep`, `rg`
- Suggests `Edit` tool instead of `sed`, `awk`
- Suggests `Glob` tool instead of `find` for file searches

#### validate-config.py

**Trigger**: Before any `Edit` or `Write` operation
**Purpose**: Validates YAML frontmatter in Claude Code customization files
**Behavior**: **Can block** operations if YAML is invalid in agents, skills, or commands
**Timeout**: 5 seconds

Checks:

- YAML frontmatter syntax in `agents/*.md`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, `commands/*.md`
- Required fields presence (name, description, etc.)
- Proper frontmatter delimiters (`---`)

#### validate-markdown.py

**Trigger**: Before any `Write` operation on `.md` files
**Purpose**: Validates markdown files using markdownlint for style consistency
**Behavior**: **Can block** operations if markdown has linting errors
**Timeout**: 5 seconds

Checks:

- Line length limits (80 characters)
- Heading formatting and spacing
- Fenced code block language specification
- List formatting and blank line requirements

### PostToolUse Hooks

Run after tool execution completes successfully.

#### auto-format.sh

**Trigger**: After any `Edit` or `Write` operation
**Purpose**: Automatically formats code files using appropriate formatters
**Behavior**: Silent formatting - never blocks or reports errors
**Timeout**: 10 seconds

Supported formatters:

- `gofmt` for `.go` files
- `prettier` for `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.json`, `.md` files

### Notification Hooks

Run when specific events occur during the session.

#### notify-idle.sh

**Trigger**: When Claude is idle and waiting for user input
**Purpose**: Sends macOS desktop notification when prompt is ready
**Behavior**: Uses `osascript` to display notification
**Timeout**: 5 seconds

Notification: "Claude Code" - "Ready for your input"

### SessionStart Hooks

Run once when a new Claude Code session starts.

#### load-session-context.sh

**Trigger**: At session startup
**Purpose**: Injects git repository context for awareness
**Behavior**: Checks for `.git` directory and outputs repository status
**Timeout**: 10 seconds

Provides:

- Current git branch
- Working tree status
- Recent commit information

### Hook Configuration

All hooks are configured in `settings.json` with:

- **Matchers**: Regular expressions to determine when hooks run
- **Timeouts**: Maximum execution time before hook is killed
- **Exit codes**: 0 = allow operation, 2 = block operation

Hooks are designed to fail gracefully - if a hook errors, it exits with code 0 to avoid blocking operations.

### Modifying Permissions

Edit `settings.json` to add tool or file pattern permissions:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allowed": ["Read", "Bash(git:*)", "Write(*.md)"],
    "denied": ["Read(.env*)", "Bash(sudo:*)"]
  }
}
```

For project-specific permissions, create `settings.local.json` in the project directory.

## Security Considerations

- `.env*` files are blocked from reading via permissions
- Lock files (`go.sum`, `package-lock.json`, etc.) are write-protected
- `sudo` commands are denied by default
- **Sensitive Data**: `.mcp.json` contains API credentials (GitHub token) - not tracked in git
- **History**: `history.jsonl` may contain sensitive conversation context - not tracked in git

## Common Operations

### Review Recent Activity

```bash
# Check recent session logs
tail -n 50 logs/session-log.txt

# View commit history
cat logs/commit-log.txt
```

### Inspect Project Metadata

```bash
# List tracked projects
ls -l projects/

# View specific project stats
cat projects/-Users-markayers-source-mine-go/meta.json | jq
```

### Manual Cleanup

Claude Code automatically cleans data older than 30 days. For manual cleanup:

```bash
# Remove old session data
find todos/ -name "*.json" -mtime +30 -delete
find debug/ -name "*.txt" -mtime +30 -delete
```
